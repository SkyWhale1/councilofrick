# Number of entries controlls amount to choose from in designer  I.E.   "mol1" "mol2" "mol3" "mol4"
# graphical_culture is connected to the looks used for ships and cities, see "common/graphical_culture/"
# Portraits here are one you can choose from in the character creater. For prescripted races they are grabbed straight from the .gfx file. 
# can specify playable=no to disable people from picking specified class.
# can specify randomized=no to filter specified class from randomization.
